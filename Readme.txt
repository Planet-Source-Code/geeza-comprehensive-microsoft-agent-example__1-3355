Comprehensive MS Agent Example by GEEZA

I decided to write this code when i saw "Agent Example" on the opening page of PLanetSourceCode, and thought "Ah-ha!  This is just what i need to get round the 'Block variable not set' error when I load the characters just before running a script, and CtlRequest not working", though it didn't (sorry)

the code had all the problems in it i had found,
so i have spent a few days on it, and fixed the problem, so i thought you might all like it, and the Truth behind agent :)

These examples include just about everything you'd need, well have a look for yourselves :)  Oh, and I've fixed the problem about running commands after Agents have completed their animations, so now you can make an agent do just about whatever you like :)

Non VB6 users-
It is written in VB6, so if you have an earlier version of VB, start VB and make a new executable, remove the form it makes, and add my "MyAgent.frm" to your project, and the other form in this zip (i forget the name), and set MyAgent.frm to be the startup form
VB shouble be able to handle this, it just doesn't like opening VB6 projects in earlier versions of VB

If not, then open up the files in NotePad and it's pretty obvious howe they're made up, so you can cut & paste the text into a new project


You will need for the full effect:
	MSAgent Server (it rus the Agents, if you have Office 2000 with 			the assistants, then you have this!
	Lernout & Hauspie TrueVoice
	Lernout & Hauspie Speech Recognition Engine  thingy
	Merlin Character
	Genie Character
	A computer (duh! :)

	A Perculator
	High caffine coffee
	Lots of spare time
	No need for sleep (optional)
	lol

All these are downloadable from the Microsoft Agent site  (except the last few, ah, I can dream can't I?)


Hope you like it :)
